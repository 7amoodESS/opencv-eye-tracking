# opencv-eye-tracking
OpenCV Python code for left and right eye motion controls
Uses haarcascade_eye.xml cascade to detect the eyes, performs Histogram Equalization, blurring and Hough circles to retrieve circle(pupil)'s x,y co-ordinates and radius (circle equation) .
 
According to these values, eye's position: either right or left is determined.
