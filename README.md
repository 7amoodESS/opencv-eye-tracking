OpenCV Python code for left and right eye motion controls
Uses haarcascade_eye.xml cascade to detect the eyes, performs Histogram Equalizatio, blurring and Hough circles to retrieve circle(pupil)'s x,y and radius. 
According to these values, eye's position: either right or left is determined. 
Thanks.
